# 0x1C. C - Makefiles

Makefiles are commonly used when you have a project with multiple source files, and the build process involves compiling these files into executable binaries or libraries. Makefiles help automate the build process and only recompile the necessary files when source code changes, which can significantly speed up the build process.
